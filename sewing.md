## Sewing

I've been sewing since I was young, and blatantly disregarding instructions since at least 2012. 

Pictures and many more projects will come at some point. 

## Dance wear
I do a lot of square and round dancing, and designing and making dance clothes has been another hobby. 

* **Red and purple square dance outfit**: Made Summer 2014. I also made a matching red and orange set for my then-significant-other. The top was a modification of a square dance top pattern, the skirt was my own design. It's a full circle, so the "design" part was mostly getting the curves right. It has pockets and a lot of curved seams. 
* **Lace dance pants**: Made Summer 2017?. Fairly normal pants, except for material choices. 
 
## Formal wear
* **Green "tinkerbell" dress**: Based on [Simplicity 2247](https://www.simplicity.com/simplicity-storefront-catalog/patterns/brands/simplicity/simplicity-pattern-2247-misses--plus-size-amazing-fit-dresses/). I had originally imagined the bottom sheer sections would drape nicely, but the tulle is fairly stiff so it ends up puffing out. Not my goal, but I think it works well. If I did it again, I would try to avoid a center front seam, and use a shoulder-princess, rather than arm-hole princess as the base. Made December 2012 for a high school formal when I was a senior. 
* **White and blue dress**: Based on Based on [Simplicity 2247](https://www.simplicity.com/simplicity-storefront-catalog/patterns/brands/simplicity/simplicity-pattern-2247-misses--plus-size-amazing-fit-dresses/). (Note that this is the same pattern as above, which mostly tells you that my belief in following patterns hasn't changed much.) This was made in Spring 2018 for a friend's wedding with a fair amount of dancing at the reception. My fabric collection (read: hoard) was large enough that I was trying to decrease its size and not buy new fabric. I'm still into godets (the triangle inserts in the skirt), and wanted to try a back cut-out.

## Costumes

- For a LARP set in the Victorian era, I may have gone a little overboard. The jacket was my own design, made from tracing the seams of the corset I would wear under it, and then using other patterns to get shoulder height. Sleeves were two piece leg-o-mutton. Skirt was heavily pleated. Buried in some of the pleats were slits to allow for accessing the many pockets on the petticoat (for holding item cards, nerf ammo, etc). In a nod to era-accuracy, I had made a bustle pad. I also made a cardboard, fabric, and glue hat.
