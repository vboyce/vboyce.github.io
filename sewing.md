## Sewing

I've been sewing since I was young, and blatantly disregarding instructions since at least 2012. 

Pictures and descriptions of sewing projects will come at some point. 

##Dance wear
 - red and purple square dance outfit. I made this Summer 2014. I also made a matching red and orange set for my then-significant-other. The top was a modification of a square dance top pattern, the skirt was my own design. It's a full circle, so the "design" part was mostly getting the curves right. It has pockets and a lot of curved seams. 
 - Dance pants
 
 
##Formal wear
 - Green "tinkerbell" dress. Based on TODO:pattern. I had originally imagined the bottom sheer sections would drape nicely, but the tulle is fairly stiff so it ends up puffing out. Not my goal, but I think it works well. If I did it again, I would try to avoid a center front seam, and use a shoulder-princess, rather than arm-hole princess as the base. Made December 2012 for a high school formal when I was a senior. 
 - White and blue dress. Based on TODO:pattern. (Note that this is the same pattern as the green one above, which mostly tells you that my belief in following patterns hasn't changed much) This was made for a friend's wedding with a fair amount of dancing at the reception. My fabric collection (read: hoard) was large enough that I was trying to decrease its size and not buy new fabric. I'm still into godets (the triangle inserts in the skirt), and wanted to try a back cut-out. 
 
## Costumes
- For a LARP set in the Victorian era, I may have gone a little overboard. The jacket was my own design, made from tracing the seams of the corset I would wear under it, and then using other patterns to get shoulder height. Sleeves were two piece leg-o-mutton. Skirt was heavily pleated. Buried in some of the pleats were slits to allow for accessing the many pockets on the petticoat (for holding item cards, nerf ammo, etc). In a nod to era-accuracy, I had made a bustle pad. I also made a cardboard, fabric, and glue hat.
