I am a postdoc in the [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) (CPL) at MIT working with Roger Levy. As of winter 2026, I'm visiting at Stanford and working from the [Language and Cognition Lab](https://langcog.stanford.edu/) where I completed my PhD in 2025. 

I'm a cognitive scientist and I study language, with a particular interest in pragmatic language use, the role of context in language processing, and developmental psycholinguistics. I also am interested in psycholinguistics methods and replicability and meta-science. 

Previously I lived in Cambridge, MA where I recieved an SB in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from MIT in 2019. During undergrad and the year after undergrad, I worked in the [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) with Roger Levy.

Before that, I grew up in Mountain View, CA. 

## Non-academic activities

### Puzzling
I enjoy many types of puzzles including jigsaws and crosswords (cryptic and otherwise). I participate in puzzle hunts sometimes, including [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/). I was on the winning team in 2014 (the first year I hunted), and so I wrote for 2015. I wrote [Lead Right](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2015/puzzle/lead_right/) (combining two of my hobbies, square dancing and cryptics), helped with [some other puzzles](https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/author/boyceveronica), and led costume design and creation. 

### Knitting
I learned to knit shortly before college, and while I mostly work from patterns (although I rarely follow them completely), I designed a [double-knit owl hat](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/parliament-of-owlets-hat?buy=1). 

### Giving to effective charities
In 2021, during the first year of grad school, I started donating 10% of my income to [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/). I took the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) pledge in 2024.
