I am a postdoc in the [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) (CPL) at MIT working with Roger Levy. I recieved my PhD in Psychology at Stanford University in 2025, where I worked in the [Language and Cognition Lab](https://langcog.stanford.edu/) working with Mike Frank. My undergraduate degree is in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from MIT. I study language, with a particular interest in how context affects language use and how language processing abilities develop across childhood. I have side interests in methods and replicability.
