Some of my research and teaching has been about building tools and infrastructure (and some infrastructure has been more incidental). These projects are listed here!

# Harmonized datasets:
- [Peekbank](https://peekbank.github.io/peekbank-website/) I'm part of the team for Peekbank, an open repository of over 40 datasets of children's looking-while-listening data

- [Refbank](refbank.stanford.edu) Refbank is an open repository of datasets from iterated reference games

# Maze task:
- [Maze documentation](https://vboyce.github.io/Maze/) I built infrastructure for automatically generating distractors for the Maze task using language models. This is somewhat out of data, but likely to be revamped for newer models in 2026. 

- [Maze for jsPsych](https://github.com/vboyce/jspsych-maze) undocumented plugin for running maze tasks in jsPsych. Likely will get improvements and better documentation in 2026. 

- Demos of Maze tasks run in jsPsych using automatically generated distractors can be found at <https://vboyce.github.io/maze-demos/>

# Teaching methods:

- [Experiments for methods class](https://github.com/vboyce/125-project-options) As a TA for Psych 125 (undergraduate research methods), I implemented 8 replications of prior psychology studies (hand-picked for previous replication success) to run online. We also collected a replication samples of data for students to analyse. The repository has the code to run the studies (mostly in jspsych, as a demonstration), our collected data, and milestones/skeleton analysis code that was given to students. 

# Reproducible manuscript templates:

- [Cogsci Rmd template](https://github.com/vboyce/cogsci-template) I updated a previous port of the cogsci template for Rmd. 

- [Stanford dissertation Rmd template](https://github.com/vboyce/stanford_thesisdown) Of even narrower interest, I made a fork of the thesisdown package when I wrote my dissertation.
