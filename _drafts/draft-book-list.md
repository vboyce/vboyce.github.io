## Books I enjoy

*Note: my listing of books here should be taken as a weak endorsement of the books. I have not done extensive fact-checking of non-fiction books nor have I attempted to figure out how good the authors are as people.*

- Merchant Prince and Empire Games series by Charles Stross. First book is The Bloodline Feud. (I recommend as well [Stross's blog posts](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/03/post-mortem.html) about how this series was created and evolved.) I also recommend his Laundry Files series, starting with The Atrocity Archives. 

- Basically everything Laurie R King writes, especially the Mary Russell & Sherlock Holmes series, starting with The Beekeeper's Apprentice. 

- The Terra Ignota series by Ada Palmer, starting with Too Like the Lightning.

- Why Fish Don't Exist by Lulu Miller

- Language at the Speed of Sight by Mark Seidenberg

- The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee
