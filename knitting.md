# Knitting

I learned to knit summer of 2013. So far, I still mostly follow patterns, but I've done a little bit of designing my own patterns. These are most of my more recent projects, and thus skew heavily toward lacework. 

## Lace
### Green Triangle Shawl

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/green-tri-2.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/green-tri-3.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/green-tri-4.jpg" height="250px" />

Made Fall 2017. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sunflower-shawl-4">Sunflower Shawl</a> from New Vintage Lace by Andrea Jurgrau. 

### Haruni Shawls

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/blue-tri-2.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/green-haruni.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/multi-haruni-1.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/multi-haruni-2.jpg" height="250px" />

Three shawls, all from the same pattern, <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/haruni"> Haruni</a> from Ravelry. The green one was the first lace piece I ever made (maybe 2015?). The multicolor and blue shawls were made in the next couple years. I highly recommend this pattern as an introduction to lace knitting; it has verbal descriptions of the overall idea of the pattern, and both charted and line-by-line instructions. (I used the charts and ignored the line-by-line, but the comparison was useful for making sure I understood how to read the charts.) 

### Owl Shawl

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/owl-1.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/owl-2.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/owl-3.jpg" height="250px" />

Large shawl knit in a heavier yarn. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/into-the-woods-owl-shawl">Into The Woods Owl</a> from Ravelry.

## Not-lace

### Bunny Hat

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/bunny-1.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/bunny-2.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/bunny-3.jpg" height="250px" />

Intarsia hat, worked "flat" and then seamed. I used this <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/humping-bunnies">pattern</a> from Ravelry for the bunnies, the rest is my own design.

### Gloves
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/gloves-1.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/gloves-2.jpg" height="250px" />

Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/slip-stitch-flip-tops">Slip Stitch Flip Tops</a> from Ravelry. Made Spring 2018. Made using the magic-loop method, as I refuse to use anything but circular needles. (Actually, every project on this page was made on circular needles, and thus magic-looped if it was worked in the round and had a small circumference.)

### Fair Isle Hat
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/fair-isle-hat-1.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/fair-isle-hat-2.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/fair-isle-hat-3.jpg" height="250px" />

Fair Isle hat. My own design, parts of the pattern adapted from <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/winter-forest-tam"> Winter Forest Tam</a> and <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hydrangea-fair-isle-doll-vest"> Hydrangea Fair Isle Doll Vest</a>. I had made the Winter Forest Tam earlier, but (at least in the yarn I used), the supposedly adult-size hat ended up toddler-sized. I was dissappointed, but gave it to an appreciative toddler. Even earlier, I had started the Doll Vest as a way to learn Fair Isle, but never finished. 

###Cabled Vest
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/bluevest1.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/bluevest2.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/bluevest3.jpg" height="250px" />

Pattern is  <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bramblewood-vest"> Bramblewood Vest</a> from Ravelry. Modifications include doing ribbing rather than i-cord to finish the neck and sleeve holes, and doing more/different waist shaping than suggested. (Made 2016?)

###Textured Skirt

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/carnaby1.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/carnaby2.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/carnaby3.jpg" height="250px" />

Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/carnaby-skirt">Carnaby Skirt</a> from Ravelry. Made Spring 2014. 

###Wrap Skirt
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/wrapskirt1.jpg" height="250px" />
<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/wrapskirt2.jpg" height="250px" />

Pattern is  <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wrap-around-skirt">Wrap Around Skirt</a> from Ravelry. (Made 2016?)

### Other, as-yet-unphotographed projects
 - Geometric colorwork hat (own design)
 - <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-dragon-slayer-dog-sweater">Dragon Slayer Dog Sweater</a> (made following the pattern, and then later modified to have a velcro opening down the tummy, cloth lining, and cloth sleeves, so it was practical for the dog to wear it without snagging or fights getting into it)
 - another dog sweater, my first (and perhaps only?) attempt at knitting from a sewing pattern
 - <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/date-night-2">Date Night</a> Made Spring 2016, in part during 9.00 lectures. In part due to yarn choice (and also pattern sizing?), did not fit me well, even after sleeve modification. I later gave it away to a friend. 
 - assorted hats and scarfs demonstrating no particular skill
