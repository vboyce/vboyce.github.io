# Knitting

I learned to knit summer of 2013. So far, I still mostly follow patterns, but I've done a little bit of designing my own patterns. These are most of my more recent projects, and thus skew heavily toward lacework. 


## Lace Shawls

<center><iframe class="slideshow-iframe" frameborder="0" src="{{site.url}}/slides/lace_shawls.html" style="width:90%; height:600px"></iframe></center>

* **Green Triangle Shawl**: Made Fall 2017. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sunflower-shawl-4">Sunflower Shawl</a> from New Vintage Lace by Andrea Jurgrau. 

* **Haruni Shawls**: Three shawls, all from the same pattern, <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/haruni"> Haruni</a> from Ravelry. The green one was the first lace piece I ever made (maybe 2015?). The multicolor and blue shawls were made in the next couple years. I highly recommend this pattern as an introduction to lace knitting; it has verbal descriptions of the overall idea of the pattern, and both charted and line-by-line instructions. (I used the charts and ignored the line-by-line, but the comparison was useful for making sure I understood how to read the charts.) 

* **Owl Shawl**: Large shawl knit in a heavier yarn. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/into-the-woods-owl-shawl">Into The Woods Owl</a> from Ravelry. 

* **Red Shawlette**: Made Spring 2017. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/willow-29">Willow</a> from New Vintage Lace by Andrea Jurgrau. 

* **Large Blue Shawl**: Made Summer 2017. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/coeur-damour">Coeur d'Amour</a> from New Vintage Lace by Andrea Jurgrau. 

* **Green Rectangular Shawl**: Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/print-o-the-wave-stole"> Print O'the Wave Stole</a> from Ravelry. Made Winter 2017-2018. 

* **Large Red Shawl**: (not pictured) Made Summer 2018. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/town-square-shawl"> Town Square Shawl</a> from New Lace Knitting by Rosemary Hill. 

## Large projects

* **Cabled Vest**: Pattern is  <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bramblewood-vest"> Bramblewood Vest</a> from Ravelry. Modifications include doing ribbing rather than i-cord to finish the neck and sleeve holes, and doing more/different waist shaping than suggested. (Made 2016?)

* **Textured Skirt**: Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/carnaby-skirt">Carnaby Skirt</a> from Ravelry. Made Spring 2014. 

* **Lace Cowl**: (not pictured) Made Summer 2018. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fallen-leaf-shell">Fallen Leaf Shell</a> from New Lace Knitting by Rosemary Hill. 

* **Leafy Cardigan**: (not pictured) Made Fall 2018. Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bright-moment-cardigan">Bright Moment Cardigan</a> from New Lace Knitting by Rosemary Hill. I don't believe in seams (at least not in my knitting), so I worked this bottom up as one piece, then picked up stitches for the sleeves and worked them both top down (magic looping both at once, so I didn't have to count rows). 

## Small projects

* **Bunny Hat**: Intarsia hat, worked "flat" and then seamed. I used this <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/humping-bunnies">pattern</a> from Ravelry for the bunnies, the rest is my own design.

* **Gloves**:Pattern is <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/slip-stitch-flip-tops">Slip Stitch Flip Tops</a> from Ravelry. Made Spring 2018. Made using the magic-loop method, as I refuse to use anything but circular needles. (Actually, every project on this page was made on circular needles, and thus magic-looped if it was worked in the round and had a small circumference.)

* **Fair Isle Hat**: Fair Isle hat. My own design, parts of the pattern adapted from <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/winter-forest-tam"> Winter Forest Tam</a> and <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hydrangea-fair-isle-doll-vest"> Hydrangea Fair Isle Doll Vest</a>. 

* **Geometric colorwork hat**: not pictured, own design
* **Puppy Coats**: (not pictured) <a src="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-dragon-slayer-dog-sweater">Dragon Slayer Dog Sweater</a> (made following the pattern, and then later modified to have a velcro opening down the tummy, cloth lining, and cloth sleeves, so it was practical for the dog to wear it without snagging or fights getting into it). I also made another dog sweater, my first (and perhaps only?) attempt at knitting from a sewing pattern.
