## About Veronica
I currently live in Cambridge, MA, where I'm an undergrad at MIT studying Brain and Cognitive Science (expected graduation in June 2019). I'm especially interested in language and how language interacts with other areas of cognition. I've been doing research in MIT's [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) since 2017. My research interests include language processing generally and specifically how our language use affects human interaction. 

My hobbies include square dancing and round dancing (both with [Tech Squares](squares.mit.edu)), puzzle hunts, board game playing, baking, sewing and knitting.
