## About Veronica
I currently live in Cambridge, MA, where I'm an undergrad at MIT studying Brain and Cognitive Science. I'm especially interested in language and how language interacts with other areas of cognition. I've been doing research in MIT's [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) since 2017. My research interests include language processing generally and specifically how our language use affects human interaction. 

My hobbies include square dancing and round dancing (both with [Tech Squares](squares.mit.edu)), puzzle hunts, board game playing, baking, sewing and knitting.

## Organized Hobbies (aka Student Groups)

I've been square dancing since 2008, and have been a member of [Tech Squares](squares.mit.edu) since 2013. I currently dance C4 (the highest level). I like challenge dancing for the the challenge of parsing calls and formations, then applying layers of abstract rules, all in real-time while convincing other people to do the same. Bigons, nose dancing, snap-switching, and other games have similar appeal. After maxing the levels of square dancing, I started learning round dancing in 2017, also with Tech Squares. I have yet to max round dancing levels.

I care enough about this hobby that I've been club officer since 2014. I didn't expect when I started to like running a student group as much as I do. As class coordinator, and later club president, I rewrote the [call definitions](http://www.mit.edu/~tech-squares/lessons/) we use during the class, co-created a [Safer Dances Policy](http://www.mit.edu/~tech-squares/govdocs/safer-dances.html) (what we call our anti-harassment policy), and revamped our [governing documents](http://www.mit.edu/~tech-squares/govdocs/). I've also been heavily involved in on-going attempts to improve the club, and in particular, our rounds program. I ran a dance weekend for 200 people in September 2018 to celebrate Tech Squares 50th. 

I also participate in puzzle hunts sometimes, including [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/). I was on the winning team in 2014 (the first year I hunted), and so I wrote for 2015. I wrote [Lead Right](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2015/puzzle/lead_right/)(combining two of my hobbies, square dancing and cryptics), helped with [some other puzzles](https://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/author/boyceveronica), and led costume design and creation. 

## Sewing and Knitting
I learned to sew when I was young, and at some point started drafting and modifying my own patterns. Various of my hobbies (squares, rounds, LARPing) provide convenient excuses for designing and making specialized clothing and costumes. (Which, while not the main motive for these hobbies, is a convenient side benefit.) I learned to knit shortly before college, and while I've designed a couple colorwork patterns myself, I still mostly follow patterns (for now).
