## About Veronica
I am a (as of September 2023, 4th year) graduate student in Psychology at Stanford University in the [Language and Cognition Lab](https://langcog.stanford.edu/) working with Mike Frank. Previously I worked as a research associate (and before that, undergraduate researcher) in the [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) at MIT. I study language, with a particular interest in pragmatic language use and how people adapt with their interlocuters. I have side interests in methods and replicability.
