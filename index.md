## About Veronica
I am a graduate student in Psychology at Stanford University in the [Language and Cognition Lab](https://langcog.stanford.edu/). Previously I worked as a research associate (and before that, undergraduate researcher) in the [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) at MIT. I study language, with a particular interest in pragmatic language use and how language interacts with social biases. 

My hobbies include square dancing and round dancing (previously with [Tech Squares](squares.mit.edu)), puzzle hunts, board game playing, baking, sewing and knitting.
