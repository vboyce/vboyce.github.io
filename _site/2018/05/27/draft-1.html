<p>Is there a principled reason to object to ‘They’re raping that song.’ and be okay with ‘They’re murdering that song.’?</p>

<p>This thought came up for me recently after hearing someone I didn’t know very well say something along the lines of the first, and my opinion of them dropped considerably. I’d heard and gone along with the doctrine that making light of sexual assault was NOT OKAY, and that using terms like ‘rape’ in metaphoric contexts such as this was making light of sexual assault.</p>

<p>But, does that logic mean that I also have to object to the use of words like murder, slaughter, butcher, massacre in equally light contexts? I haven’t learned that, and I don’t see a lot of people complaining about that. I see a little of that in terms of using the terms gulag or holocaust lightly.</p>

<p>When I brought this up with a friend, they suggested that the relevant difference between rape and murder was that there’s a lot of discourse out there making light of rape (and a lot of people who think it isn’t serious), and not much discourse making light of murder. Murder, that’s bad, is pretty generally agreed, to the point where, when people want to discount murder, they call it something else. So, using murder in an exaggerated way isn’t hurting anyone because there’s no “murder culture” for it to be adding to. It might not go over well with people who are close to a murder victim (I don’t have evidence either way), but there may be a strong argument that using “rape” lightly contributes to the acceptability of sexual assault, while using “murder” lightly does not contribute to the acceptability of killing.</p>

<p>This pattern of argument also allows us to draw a line between massacre and holocaust or slaughter and genocide. It’s not okay to use lightly those that some people actual don’t think are serious, because people (both the “bad” people and the “good” people) might get confused and take your speech as supporting the view that what those words refer to isn’t serious.</p>

<p>But murder and slaughter basically everyone can interpret correctly without getting confused and thinking that you might be implying that killing people is okay.</p>
