<p>I’ve been sewing since I was young, and blatantly disregarding instructions since at least 2012.</p>

<p>Pictures and descriptions of sewing projects will come at some point.</p>

<p>##Dance wear</p>
<ul>
  <li>red and purple square dance outfit. I made this Summer 2014. I also made a matching red and orange set for my then-significant-other. The top was a modification of a square dance top pattern, the skirt was my own design. It’s a full circle, so the “design” part was mostly getting the curves right. It has pockets and a lot of curved seams.</li>
  <li>Dance pants</li>
</ul>

<p>##Formal wear</p>
<ul>
  <li>Green “tinkerbell” dress. Based on TODO:pattern. I had originally imagined the bottom sheer sections would drape nicely, but the tulle is fairly stiff so it ends up puffing out. Not my goal, but I think it works well. If I did it again, I would try to avoid a center front seam, and use a shoulder-princess, rather than arm-hole princess as the base. Made December 2012 for a high school formal when I was a senior.</li>
  <li>White and blue dress. Based on TODO:pattern. (Note that this is the same pattern as the green one above, which mostly tells you that my belief in following patterns hasn’t changed much) This was made for a friend’s wedding with a fair amount of dancing at the reception. My fabric collection (read: hoard) was large enough that I was trying to decrease its size and not buy new fabric. I’m still into godets (the triangle inserts in the skirt), and wanted to try a back cut-out.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="costumes">Costumes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For a LARP set in the Victorian era, I may have gone a little overboard. The jacket was my own design, made from tracing the seams of the corset I would wear under it, and then using other patterns to get shoulder height. Sleeves were two piece leg-o-mutton. Skirt was heavily pleated. Buried in some of the pleats were slits to allow for accessing the many pockets on the petticoat (for holding item cards, nerf ammo, etc). In a nod to era-accuracy, I had made a bustle pad. I also made a cardboard, fabric, and glue hat.</li>
  <li>Kraken from mystery hunt</li>
  <li>Time lord costume</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="corsets">Corsets</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Grey cord</li>
  <li>Silk</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="normal-clothes">Normal clothes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>adventures in button-ups</li>
  <li>tailored jacket</li>
  <li>other dresses</li>
  <li>dart on turq cord skirt</li>
</ul>
